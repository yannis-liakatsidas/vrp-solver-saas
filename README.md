# VRP Solver SaaS â€“ Proof of Concept

This repository contains an academic proof-of-concept for a scalable, value-for-money **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solver** built as a **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** system. It demonstrates how open-source tools, asynchronous messaging, and distributed architecture can be combined to solve complex computational problems efficiently, without relying on costly commercial solutions.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This solution leverages **RabbitMQ**, **Google OR-Tools**, and a **modular, service-based architecture** to solve VRP instances in a scalable and resilient way. The architecture promotes extensibility to other types of computational problems by replacing the solver core.

### Key Highlights:
- âœ… Modular and decoupled service architecture
- âœ… Uses **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication (Pub/Sub)
- âœ… Solver uses **Google OR-Tools**
- âœ… Built with scalability and resilience in mind
- âœ… Designed as a **value-for-money** alternative to licensed solvers
- âœ… Academic, non-commercial project focused on demonstrating architectural feasibility

## ðŸ§© System Components

| Component              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **VRP Data Generator**     | Generates input data for testing various VRP scenarios. |
| **Send Data Service**      | Sends generated data to the message broker. |
| **Broker Web API**         | Publishes data to RabbitMQ queues for processing. |
| **Consume Data Service**   | Subscribes to the appropriate queues, receives data, and synchronizes delivery to the solver. |
| **Solver Web API**         | Receives data on the solver node, processes requests via RESTful endpoints. |
| **Execute VRP Service**    | Implements the solver logic using [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization), producing results for each VRP instance. |

## ðŸ§ª Scope and Purpose

> This application is **academic** in nature and intended to prove the viability of a SaaS-based approach to solving computationally hard problems (like VRP) using open-source and distributed systems design principles.

While this implementation focuses on **Vehicle Routing Problems**, the system is designed to be flexible. By replacing the core solver logic, other computational problems (e.g., scheduling, optimization, routing) can be plugged into the same framework.
